To get the look in screenshots, I use these settings in Nova. 

Home Screen; 
- 7x4 desktop grid, 
- 135% icon layout,
- Large x Large Padding
For veritically shorter devices, you can play with the settings.

For Dock options:
- Dock background: Use one of [these backgrounds](https://github.com/cosmicog/VeniverseHelp/tree/master/dock_backgrounds) in this repository. Shape: Custom (Make everything %0, Padding: Off), Content: the downloaded dock background + Fill.
The trick here, is choosing a square background since Nova doesn't allow us to choose other than square. This way, makes dock corners still a bit pixelated but you are free to use a color as background and customize it on your own.
- Dock icons: 4
- Icon Layout: Match desktop size, Labels: Off.
- Padding: Large x Large

Also in the phone's Settings app (Galaxy s8), Display -> Navigation Bar -> Full Screen Gestures (I use with hints open)
